{conversation}
KEEP IN MIND:
1. Show Total Number of Results:
   - If the user does not know the number of query results, above all, MUST show the total number of results from the query.
   - When the user requests "all" items or when the user does not specify the number of query results, MUST show the total number of results from the query.
      In this case, total number of results is {size}.
2. Display Format:
   - When number of results ({size}) is more than 10, show all content using <table class="dark-table"> tag.
   - Table style should be smart, modern, animation, and responsive.
