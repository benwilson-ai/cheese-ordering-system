Given an input question, output a syntactically correct SQLite query to run
You need to generate MySQL Query for cheese.
This MySQL Database includes information about the cheeses.

Here is SQL Query that is used to create table.
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cheese_data (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  type: VARCHAR(255), //type is cheese name
  form: VARCHAR(255), //form is cheese category. e.g. slice
  brand: VARCHAR(255), //brand is the most important
  price: FLOAT, //price per each
  price_per_lb: VARCHAR(255), //price per lb or price per LOAF or price per OZ or price per CT
  case_count: DECIMAL(10,2), // number of items per case
  case_volume: VARCHAR(255), // volume of one case
  case_weight: VARCHAR(255), // weight of one case
  each_count: DECIMAL(10,2), // number of items per each(always 1)
  each_volume: VARCHAR(255), // volume of one each
  each_weight: VARCHAR(255), // weight of one each
  sku DECIMAL(10,10), 
  upc DECIMAL(10,10),
  image_url VARCHAR(255), // url of cheese's picture uploaded
  product_url VARCHAR(255), // url of cheese's detail infomation
  wholesale VARCHAR(255), // variable whether this cheese has wholesale price or not. If Yes, wholesale="Buy 10+ pay $...", if Not, wholesale="It has no wholesale price"
  out_of_stock VARCHAR(255) // variable whether this cheese is out of stock or not. If Yes, out_of_stock="BACK IN STOCK SOON", if Not, wholesale="It is not out of stock"
)

When you generate query, only generate one that is compatible for these data types.

These are the information of each property:
id: This is a unique identifier for each record in the table. It's used to distinguish one record from another and is often used as a primary key. The id field is automatically incremented for each new record inserted into the table, ensuring that each record has a unique identifier.

type: This field stores the name of the cheese, such as "Cheddar", "Mozzarella", or "Feta". The type field is a string value that can be up to 255 characters long, allowing for a wide range of cheese names.

You need to generate 'SELECT *' Query for this table.
Only generate SQL query.
Do not generate any other messages such as explanation of the generation, extra guidance, etc.
You must generate SQL Query ONLY.

Please generate MySQL query to gather information for following query.
The query is as follows.
{query}

Here is the original conversation.
{conversation}

When generating the query:

- Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most 1 results.
- You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
- Do not include any special characters such as ` at the end or beginning of the generation.
- And also, do not include any other things that is not related to SQL query itself.
For example one genration you made is as follows.
```SELECT id, type\nFROM cheese_data\nORDER BY price\nLIMIT 5;```

instead of this you need to generate following one.
SELECT id, type\nFROM cheese_data\nORDER BY price DESC\nLIMIT 5;

Double check the SQLite query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins
- Don't include any unnecessary charaters like `, ", ', ...
- Don't include any other things that is not related to SQL query itself.
- For string values, don't use =, use LIKE instead.

If there are any of the above mistakes, rewrite the query. If there are no mistakes, just reproduce the original query.
